I have been a super-amateur birdwatcher since a couple of years, (I think I could mark my start probably around the summer of 2013). However, I never really kept notes, which I will do from time to time here.

- Yesterday (27/09/18) I saw a common sandpiper [*Actitis hypoleucos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sandpiper) in the Bourgoyen who was shaking his/her ass (teetering) all the time. The bird was wading and foraging in a little muddy puddle. I don't think they are very common in Belgium. They are smaller than I expected sandpipers to be, so it took quite a while to ascertain myself of the species. However their characteristic behavior while foraging makes them actually quite easy to discern.
